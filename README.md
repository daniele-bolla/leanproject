# Topological Sine Curve: Connected but Not Path-Connected (Lean 4 Formalization)

This project is a Lean 4 formalization of the classical result that the **topological sine curve** is connected but not path-connected.

It was developed as an exercise to learn Lean 4, based on the exposition by Konrad Conrad in his paper:

The formalized and reviewed proof is available as a pull request in Mathlib4:
